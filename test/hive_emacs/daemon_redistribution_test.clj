  "Tests for ling redistribution (Multi-Daemon W4).

   Covers:
   - Overloaded daemon detection (degraded health, high ling count)
   - Migration candidate finding (idle lings only)
   - Redistribution planning (score threshold, max migrations)
   - Migration execution (rebind, race condition guards)
   - Full redistribute-lings! orchestration
   - Redistribution status monitoring
   - Edge cases (no overloaded, no targets, working lings skipped)"
