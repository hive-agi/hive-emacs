(ns hive-emacs.daemon-scoring
  "Pure health-scoring computation for Emacs daemons.

   Extracted from daemon-selection to separate pure scoring algorithms
   from I/O-bound selection and heartbeat orchestration.

   Contains:
   - Health classification (health-level, healthy?)
   - EWMA-based health score computation
   - Latency, error, and load penalty calculations
   - Pure heartbeat helpers (metrics, tx-data, report)
