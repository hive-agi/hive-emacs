  "Daemon selection logic for multi-daemon ling distribution.

   Selects the healthiest daemon with capacity for new ling spawns.
   This is about PROCESS DISTRIBUTION, not data isolation — DataScript
   is unified across all daemons (ADR-010).

   Selection criteria (ranked):
   1. Health score (higher = better) — :emacs-daemon/health-score 0-100
   2. Capacity (fewer lings = better) — max 5 lings per daemon
   3. Status filter — only :active daemons considered
   4. Project affinity (optional) — prefer daemons already hosting same-project lings

   DDD: Domain Service — stateless selection algorithm."
