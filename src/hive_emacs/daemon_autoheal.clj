(ns hive-emacs.daemon-autoheal
  "Auto-heal orphan cleanup for multi-daemon architecture (W3).

   Detects lings bound to dead/unhealthy daemons (orphans) and either:
   1. Rebinds them to a healthy daemon (if idle)
   2. Marks working lings' tasks as failed and releases claims (graceful termination)

   Integration: Called from daemon_store.clj heartbeat loop on each cycle.

   ADR-010: Compute isolation, not data isolation. DataScript is unified —
   orphan cleanup works across all daemons from a single coordinator view."
