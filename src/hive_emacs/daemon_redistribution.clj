(ns hive-emacs.daemon-redistribution
  "Ling redistribution across Emacs daemons.

   Redistributes lings from overloaded/degraded daemons to healthier ones.
   Unlike W3 (autoheal) which handles DEAD daemons, redistribution handles
   ALIVE but stressed daemons — the Emacs process is still running but is
   degraded or overloaded.

   Redistribution is conservative:
   1. Only moves IDLE lings (never interrupts working lings)
   2. Only migrates when the target daemon is significantly better
   3. Caps migrations per cycle to avoid thundering herd
   4. Respects project affinity (prefers same-project daemons)

   DDD: Domain Service — stateless redistribution algorithm.
   Separated from daemon-selection (SRP: selection vs redistribution)."
